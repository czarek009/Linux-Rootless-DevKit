## ‚ö° Powerlevel10k (`p10k`) Prompt

[Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is a powerful and ultra-fast Zsh prompt theme with a focus on **speed**, **customizability**, and **useful visual context**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

If `p10k` is installed and set as the theme (`ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"` in `.zshrc`), run the configuration wizard:

```bash
p10k configure
```

This will walk you through customizing:

- Prompt style (classic, rainbow, lean, etc.)
- Icons, spacing, and colors
- Git status indicators
- Left/right segment layout

Your preferences will be saved to `~/.p10k.zsh`, which you can manually edit anytime for fine-grained control.

### üß† Tips

- To reload prompt config:  
  ```bash
  source ~/.p10k.zsh
  ```

- To re-run the configuration wizard:  
  ```bash
  p10k configure
  ```
